## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Dependencies `(requirements.txt)`
- Python 3.8 or higher
- A Discord bot accaunt
- Basic understanding of python and command line

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ItzPopelka/RaidBOT.git
    cd RaidBOT
    ```

2.  **Install required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure the bot:**
    Open `bot.py` in a text editor and locate the `bot.run()` line at the bottom. Replace `'YOUR_USER_TOKEN_HERE'` with your actual Discord user token.
    > **⚠️ Critical:** Never share this token. Anyone with it can control your account.

4.  **Run the bot:**
    ```bash
    python bot.py
    ```
    The bot will log in, load all command modules, and be ready in your Discord client.

## ⚠️ Legal & Safety Disclaimer

**This software is provided strictly for educational purposes.** Understanding how these tools work can help server administrators better defend against them.

- **Violates Discord ToS:** Using a selfbot or automating a user account is explicitly forbidden by Discord.
- **High Risk:** Your Discord account will very likely be **permanently banned** if detected.
- **Ethical Use:** Only use this in private servers you own or with **explicit, written permission** from the server owner. Never use it to harass others or damage communities.

The developer (`ItzPopelka`) is **not responsible** for any consequences resulting from the use of this code, including account termination, legal action, or damage to online communities.

## 🔧 Command Loading

The bot dynamically loads all valid `.py` modules from the `funcs/` directory. The core loading logic in `bot.py` is as follows:

```python
import os
async def load_extensions():
    funcs_dir = "funcs"
    extensions = [f[:-3] for f in os.listdir(funcs_dir) 
                  if f.endswith('.py') and f != '__init__.py']
    for ext in extensions:
        try:
            await bot.load_extension(f"{funcs_dir}.{ext}")
            print(f"loaded: {ext}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"failed to load {ext}: {e}")
```
