# RaidBOT - ItzPopelka

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project is for **educational and demonstration purposes only**. Using it to disrupt Discord servers may violate **Discord Terms of Service** and local laws. The author assumes **no responsibility** for misuse.

A modular **Discord bot** written in Python using `discord.py`. It uses a **bot token** (not a user/self token) and loads commands dynamically via cogs.

---

## ✅ Key Points

* Uses **Discord Bot Token** (OAuth2 bot application)
* **Prefix commands**: `r?[command]`
* Modular cog-based architecture
* You dont need the perms - the bot does

---

## 📦 Requirements

* Python **3.8+**
* `discord.py`
* `requirements.txt` installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
* A **Discord Bot Application** with required *(All for no bugs)* intents enabled

---

## 🚀 Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
*Open terminal and paste this in*
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ItzPopelka/raidbot.github.io.git
cd raidbot.github.io
```

2. **Install dependencies**
*Open terminal and paste this in*
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Create a Discord Bot**
*Make it look like legit bot*
* Go to Discord *[Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/)*
* Create an application → Bot
* Copy the **BOT TOKEN**
* Enable **Server Members Intent** and **Message Content Intent**

4. **Configure token**
*You need bot token (not user!)*
- Create token.json file
- Paste this in: ```{"TOKEN": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"}```
- Replace "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN" with your actual token

> ❗ Never send anyone or publish your token.

5. **Run the bot**
*Open terminal and paste this in*
```bash
cd raidbot.github.io
python main.py
```

## 🧠 Development Notes

* Commands are loaded dynamically from `funcs/`
* Prefix is hardcoded as `r?`
* Intents are set to `Intents.all()` — adjust for production
